# Meta-PCD
This is our implementation of Meta-PCD which is a meta-network-based method for point cloud denoising.

# Prerequisites
CUDA and CuDNN (changing the code to run on CPU should require few changes)
Python 2.7
PyTorch 1.0

# Setup
Install required python packages, if they are not already installed (tensorboardX is only required for training):

pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install tensorboardX

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/xtwang2020/Meta-PCD.git
cd Meta-PCD
